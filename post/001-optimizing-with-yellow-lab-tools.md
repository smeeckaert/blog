# Optimizing a website with Yellow Lab Tools

Posted on: 2015/11/10

_In this post I will discuss how I've drastically improved performances on a website using Yellow Lab Tools_

__TL;DR__ : Optimize your images, check what your JS is doing, clean your CSS

## What's YLT ?

I've recently discovered a website analytic tool called [Yellow Lab Tools](https://github.com/gmetais/YellowLabTools/).

Basically it's a node app that uses [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) as a browser and collect data with
[Phantomas](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas).

It's incredibly powerful, fast and you can install it locally and that kick ass.

The level of detail is amazing and while there are some tweaking and the app is not perfect it's incredibly strong.

## General considerations

The website I made my experiments onto was for a client of the web agency i work for, Novius.

It's the website of the national theater of Marseille, [La Cri√©e](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Cri%C3%A9e).

This website was developed with [Novius OS](http://www.novius-os.org/) an open-source in-house PHP CMS.

I did it with some time constraint, I took three hours only to optimize the best I could and see the results.

## How are we doing ?

I started my tests on the homepage, the heaviest page of the website (and of most website). Once I have decided that
this one was good enough, I would test others as well.

Short answer : __bad__, really bad...

![This is bad, and I definitely feel bad](001_ressources/001-screen.png)

Seeing this I realized that even with some optimizations that I made
(pre/post processing of style and js, image caching, ...) the website was style ridiculously heavy and slow.

The score of 0/100 is a slap in the face, but a good one, now we need to investigate to see what we can do to improve
this score.

## Analyzing the results

There is a lot of informations in this report and it's not really clear what has a real importance on the score, so
i decided to not care about the score, but to try to remove as much red dots as possible.]

### Page weight
First we have the page weight. Having any red dot here is unacceptable to me, it will weight on every visitor,
particularly on mobile, we really need to improve that.

### Requests
Then we have requests, there seems to have way to many requests, even if the scores are good-ish, it's one of the
biggest frustration for mobile users and it's a sign of a faultly conception, if we have ~70 requests on one page
there is a problem that could easily snowball if it's not adressed.

### DOM Manipulation
There is some bad score (even more in production) in the DOM manipulations section. While investigating i detected that
it mostly came from a slideshow plugin or the off-canvas menu. Unfortunately there is little room for improvement here
without changing/rewriting plugins and it didn't fit in my time frame.

### Bad javascript
There is an apparent Javascript error in the Bad Javascript section. I could reproduce it and it doesn't appear in
pre-production so I guess it's an error thrown by YLT on local webservers.

### jQuery
For some reason we had a really outdated version of jQuery (from march 2012 !). I just updated it. I think this error
could be rated higher than that because it's really simple to upgrade jQuery and there is little to none compatibility
issues.

### CSS

Now we hit some big part. Our CSS sucks. Over 3700 rules, 150+ colours defined, old prefixes, importants everwhere.
This need optimizing, and a lot.

## Attacking the page weight

Being on a development environment, gzip was not enabled for some reason. For the same reason, my javascript files were
not concatenated nor compressed on development, i did some tweak to change this behaviour for YLT and i got rid of two
of my red dots.

Now we need to look at the total weight, we go in the details and see this.

![Send all the things, now !](001_ressources/weight/001-weight.png)

It was half expected but yeah that's a big lot of requests.

Most of them came either from Youtube or strangely from an app we have developed in the CMS that displays form.

### Cleaning js dependancies

To reduce youtube's payload I decided to remove temporarly the youtube video embeded in the homepage. And I had the bad
surprise to find that the youtube API was loaded on every page even if there was no video at all. It's a small improvement
but here goes 4-5 requests gone on every pages. (The api loads some CSS and require some JS).

The form app had some issues as well, even if i had put the app's js in my bundled js, this one would autoload some polyfill
adding even more requests, and on every page as well. Some minor modifications made me add the polyfill package into
my bundled js and only load some polyfill when really needed.



### Optimizing images

Next we see that most images are huge and take more than half of the page size. So I go to the image optimization details
and see this.

![Now we'll be shipping .tiff](001_ressources/weight/003-image-size.png)

God that's a load of unoptimized image. And there was numerous other examples in the website.

I opted for two major changes:
* Crop image when needed when they were scaled down by the browser.
* Drop jpeg quality to 75% and even 60% for the big 1600x900 full screen images.


Here you can see the differences between the 100% quality image and the 60% one.

Can you spot a difference ? Me neither, but one is nearly 600kb and the other one is 140kb, that's a huge difference.

![Am i big ?](001_ressources/weight/004-image-full-hd.png)
![Or am i light ?](001_ressources/weight/005-image-60.png)

That's a load of file size reduced and now the only biggest files we have are youtube's javascripts.

![Youtube, don't be bloating.](001_ressources/weight/006-weight-after.png)

It gets even better without youtube dropping from __3.59Mb__ to __597kb__. That's a big ass improvement !

![Are we small yet ?](001_ressources/weight/007-weight-after-no-yt.png)

Now with two little changes we lowered 7 time the page weight making it acceptable on mobile.

## Cleaning CSS

YLT gives us tools that detect bad CSS pratices. It will detect a high number of rules, redundant rules or even
bad practices like usage of !important.

While not all theses things can impact the load speed of the website, they are symptomatic of a conception problem,
and unnecessarily bloat the browser with fantom rules.

### Cleaning the framework
So lets take a look to the [huge number of universal selector](001_ressources/css/001-foundation.png) in the app. I
chose universal selector because it's a good indicator of bad pratices.

And as you can see in the linked image, most of them seems to come from Foundation. Because, like i thought, the complete
Foundation package is compiled in the CSS even if the website only use a small subset of the features like
the grid and some typo rules.

Even when removing a lot of the files, there are still problems emerging from foundation, as you can see there is a lot
of duplicated colours :

![Foundation, taste the rainbow](001_ressources/css/002-colour-count.png)

It gets better when I just simply removed all foundations colours.

![Can you guess the main color of the website ?](001_ressources/css/003-colour-opti.png)

It may seems like a micro optimization, but it's the kind of change that prevent colours from foundation to just
pop from nowhere from a selector you just forgot to override.

![You have work to do foundation...](001_ressources/css/004-cleanfoundation.png)

So with theses little modifications I went from D to C in YLT, but more importantly I got rid of more than 1500 CSS
rules and a shitload of old prefixes by just doing it making the CSS more maintainable overall.

### Can I have an A ?

Of course, I'm not thrilled by the score given by Yellow Lab Tools, but when we look closer, most errors come from
a huge number of [!important](001_ressources/css/006-important.png) and of [redudant selectors](001_ressources/css/005-redundant.png).

The first one come with Foundation, and while I don't condone the pratice, there is little I can do about it except
dropping Foundation as a whole, what I will not do anytime soon, but maybe we will need to take a good look at Skeleton.

The other one come from the usage of the selector ```ul li``` as a bad practice according to YLT, it considers that it's
useless to put ul in the selector since a li will always be contained in an ul. But writing my stylesheets in sass,
this kind of selector is hard to prevent easily so I've decided to ignore them and call it a day.

## Conclusion

So here it is, it took me more time to write this post than to optimize this website and the results are incredible for
the little amount of time I spent doing it.

### Results

Here are the results in the development environment.

And on the pre-production server.

### Load time

The load time has been drastically reduced too.

Here's the load before the optimizations (throttled at 2MBps)

![Here we go !](001_ressources/006-speed-after.png)

And in production, with all scripts minified

![Now we're getting something nice !](001_ressources/007-speed-prod.png)

### Yellow Lab Tools

YLT is an excellent tool, even if the scoring system is far from perfect and can be a little aggressive sometimes,
it points to conception mistakes and errors with its in depth analysis.

It's far more precise than the other tools that I tried until now and is definitely going to be integrated in my
everyday working process. I've installed it on my machine and it runs blazing fast and helps you deliver quality websites.
